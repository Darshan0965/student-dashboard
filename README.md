## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **Smart Student Performance & Attendance Dashboard** is a complete academic management system designed to manage thousands of students, classes, marks, timetables, and attendance. It provides a clean UI, fast backend, and professional charts to visualize academic performance.

This system is built for **real colleges, universities, schools, and departments**.

## 📈 How Performance Charts Work  
Charts are generated by **Chart.js**, using data fetched from server API:

- `/attendance/:studentId` → Donut chart  

Javascript processes the JSON data and draws animated charts on canvas elements.
